# Eye-Movement

## Description
To allow this program to run, download all of the files in this repository and drag your index.html file onto a web browser. Once your page has loaded, you can start moving your cursor around the page and the eyes will follow wherever it goes.

## Future Improvements
I would like to add a button that can close the eyes and open them. Also, it would be cool to add a mouth and then somehow be able to feed the face with a food picture or something!

## License
The MIT license is attached in this repository.
